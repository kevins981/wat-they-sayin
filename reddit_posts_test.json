        "text": "I'm not a fan of single pod coffee machines, but the Bruvi seems good. It will be somewhat difficult to rely on only their coffees. Does anyone have regrets on purchasing the Bruvi? Anyone very satisfied,  if so, why? I put milk or half & half in my coffee...I prefer steamed milk, but the machine doesn't have that option.",

                "body": "I just got a Bruvi a couple of weeks ago. Admittedly I am not a huge fan of coffee in general- more of the drink it out of necessity type- but the machine itself is great and super high quality and aesthetic. IMO the coffee is a lot better than keurig types, and comparable but not quite as good as those made by higher end Nespresso machines. The espresso variety pods are actually some of the best espresso I‚Äôve had. The pods are quite a bit more expensive than typical pods, and there are more limited options but I was happy to compromise for the quality. I love the ‚Äúlow acid‚Äù feature which brews to reduce bitterness, and the ‚Äúhotter‚Äù function when I want to use hot water for black tea. Really looking forward to trying the cold brew pods next. Also love that the pods are designed to breakdown faster in landfills than typical plastics or compostable pods. \n\nIn summary: No regrets. I kept my keurig out just in case I wanted to revert and haven‚Äôt yet.",

                "body": "I really wanted to like this machine!!! The brew quality is better than my 5yo Keurig machine but it‚Äôs second to Nespresso. Here are my issues & why I should‚Äôve waited to donate the Keurig: \nFirst & foremost the system hasn‚Äôt yet been hacked to work with alternate pods. Even if you fill your own with pods purchased from Bruvi, you are looking at close to $50 for 2 eco-pods ‚Ä¶ they probably cost less than $2 to make. I looked at the eco-pods because the company sold lots of units over the holidays but didn‚Äôt have enough coffee supply for their most popular blends. This seems to have been resolved but their pods are extremely overpriced. In addition, all used pods go into an internal receptacle which seems unnecessary & requires additional cleaning. The handle to release a used pod hits the top of my standard measure cabinetry, preventing the pod from releasing. I have to pull the machine out and away from the backsplash in order to fully open the unit.\nSecond, while pods supposedly decompose quickly, this hasn‚Äôt actually been proven, so I don‚Äôt feel as confident as I did with the San Francisco coffee pods (which meet  stricter composting guidelines). \nThird, the system doesn‚Äôt consistently deliver the correct number of ounces selected. This has been an issue with the eco-pods & the Bruvi Americano coffee pods (I‚Äôm not confusing this with the espresso pods). I‚Äôve chosen a 10oz brew for years but the Bruvi often delivers 8oz. I thought I was nuts until I actually used a measuring cup & confirmed a system error.\nFourth, a major selling point for Bruvi is brewing tea. Neither this feature,  or the rumored of teas varieties have come to  fruition (at least since last I checked).  This means about 1/3 of the features aren‚Äôt available to consumers.\nIn sum, the Bruvi feels like a product launched by young entrepreneurs with lots of potential & good intentions. However, their marketing & distributions teams seem to have outpaced their development & testing teams. I‚Äôm still hoping for an \n announcement about grand improvements but I‚Äôm not hopeful.  Sorta wishing I‚Äôd spent top dollar for a Nespresso or De‚ÄôLonghi system. I still wish them luck - just wish I hadn‚Äôt signed up to be a guinea pig. üò¢",
